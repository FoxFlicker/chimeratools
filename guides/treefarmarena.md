# Tree Farming Arena Guide

Tree Farm Arena allows for quick farming of Northmount trees.


Supports a team of 4 currently as larger teams may yield dire results.


## Setup

1. **Team Leader with AOE heavy pet**
2. **3 Runners**
4. **A lot of dew**
5. An arena in Northmount placed away from trees


When team fills, all members should post how many of each dew they have.


24, 9, 4, 0, 2 would tell the team you have 24 basic dew, 9 of the next tier, 4 of the next, and 2 of the final tier of dew. When runners type "dew" into chat, all players should give a recount.


**Do not worry about collecting rewards box. It will be sent to your mailbox.**


## Process

### Team Leader

Your only focus is fighting. Clear the mobs as quickly as possible while staying within the bounds of the arena. A strong **serpent**, **artigra**, or **jingwei** is highly recommended.

Check chat to make sure players are entering the first letter of their names before starting tree. This prevents leeching.


Use provided couches to heal yourself and pets in combat. Do not stay idle for long, or you'll get overrun.


### Runners


3 runners will head to separate parts of Northmount and find a tree that's able to be cultivated.


Approach the tree and follow these steps carefully as failure will result in you having to clear the tree alone.


1. Type the first letter of your name into team chat.
2. Select Teleport > Select Team.
3. Activate and select dew before reaching a loading screen
4. The rest of the team should count to 2, checkmark dew, and hit accept.
5. Leave the arena, rinse, repeat.


Do not stay in the arena after dropping mobs off. Find another tree.


Check with team before activating high tier dew. This ensures everyone has one, but also lets the leader know you're bringing a strong wave.


## Notes


**Runners**, Teleporting gives you 5 seconds to select dew and teleport. If you are too quick and the team accepts before you've reached the loading screen, your teleport will fail and you will be stuck fighting the enemies alone.


Make sure you haven't been targeted upon approaching tree. Being attacked will cancel your teleport.


Efficient runners will have a good knowledge of the teams dew count and ensure everyone can get rewards.


If runners run out of dew, return to the arena and fight. Switch roles with team leader if they have remaining dew and you have a decent clear speed. **Make sure team leader passes leadership to you before any trees are activated.**


**All players present for tree activation will earn exp and rewards from anywhere on map. Boxes can contain higher tiered dew, check mailbox for dew if you run out**


The Home Shop can supply large amounts of dew weekly. It is recommended to get as many as possible for the best results.



Don't overwhelm yourself with the process, it's very simple to do. If you're new and doubting yourself, inform your team mates so that the other runners can be nearby to assist you if you mess up the first time.



**Known Issues**

I've been told that too many tree activations can produce dire results including losing all of your dew. It is currently unknown why this occurs. I do not know how many activations are allowed at a single time before this happens
