                <span>This guide aims to help those still getting to end game and addresses some of the more common

                            Bind your account as soon as possible to prevent data loss. All of the servers lead to the
                            same place since the servers were merged together.

                            You're able to morph into and mix & match any of the races later on.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There are no significant differences in the various races. Recipes for the items to unlock
                            these races do vary in difficulty
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you are thinking of starting over, I'd recommend choosing a Scaly, Kunze, or Furungulate
                            as their morph items are the most expensive to craft, but not worth restarting for.

            <h2>Gaining Power</h2>
            <p>
                Gaining BP is a slow crawl most of the time. That is normal, and is what the developers intended to entice you to spend more money on the game.</p>
            <p>Therefore I feel obligated to let you know:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>This game is very much Pay 2 Win and many of the players have paid thousands or more.</li>
                <li>If you decide not to spend money on the game, you may see very slow results towards your power.
                </li>
                <li>I'm not advertising for the game, my point is that seeing other members suddenly soar beyond you in
                    power doesn't mean you're behind or doing something wrong.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>So what should I do?</h3>
            <p>Start by assessing what your current power is made of. Access your Character Panel and find the Power Up
                tab.<br>
                Here you'll see how much power you're gaining from all of the possible sources.</p>
