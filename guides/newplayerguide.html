    <p>You're likely not following this guide for your first time playing, so I'm just going to leave a few comments.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Don't stress if you don't like avatar you chose. You're able to morph and mix & match any of the races later on.
    </li>
<li>
    There are no significant differences in abilities. Recipes for the items to unlock these races do vary in difficulty
</li>
<li>
Therefore I recommend choosing a Scaly, Kunze, or Furungulate as their items are the most expensive to craft.
