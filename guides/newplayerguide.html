        <h2><b>First steps.. Creating your Character.</b></h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Bind your account as soon as possible to prevent data loss. All of the servers lead to the same place since the servers were merged together.
    </li>
    <li>
        You're able to morph into and mix & match any of the races later on.
    </li>
<li>
    There are no significant differences in the various races. Recipes for the items to unlock these races do vary in difficulty
</li>
<li>
If you are thinking of starting over, I'd recommend choosing a Scaly, Kunze, or Furungulate as their morph items are the most expensive to craft, but not worth restarting for.

<div class="content"><p>Not going to go over this much.</p>
    <p>Your hit points are represented by top orange bar on the right of the screenshot.</p>
    <p>Your pet and attendant's hit points are directly below with the pet being on the left.</p>
    <p>A numerical value for your hit points can be seen in the Character menu.</p>

    <p>The menu on the left is your quick consumables for yourself and your companions.
        <p>It's worth mentioning that the mount/attendant's tab can be configured to auto use a pet potion when pet reaches the specified HP percentage.</p>

        <div class="section-heading">Picking a Faction</div>
        <div class="content"><p>Picking a faction among the first things you'll do and is also one of the most important.
        Over time, you'll get to know the other members of your faction and may even end up in the same clan.</p>
    <p>ChimeraLand is divided into three major continents and two high-level unfactioned continents:</p>
<ul class="quarter">
    <li>Westmount - Bearie</li>
    <li>Southmount - Nine Li</li>
    <li>Eastmount - Fiery Hills</li>
</ul>

<ul class="quarter">
    <li>Centralmount - A large PVP zone in the center with themed biomes, and Honor Beasts</li>
    <li>Northmount - The newest addition to the map, with sacred tree trials and very strong enemies.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="content"><p>Central and North are open to anybody wishing to build there,  though the areas aren't meant for players before level 50.
    Any differences between the continents are minor and shouldn't affect your experience.</p>
    <p>You are able to change factions at the cost of 500 Sage. (Location needed)</p></div>
<div class="content"><h3>The in-game tutorials are absolutely necessary to understand some of this games' in depth mechanics and procedures.</h3>
    <b>If you choose to ignore these tutorials</b> you will have a tough time with this game. If something doesn't make sense, explain that to your clan.
    However asking endless questions because you chose to skip the tutorial will typically end in dismissal from your clan.

    <section class="twothird container" id="whattodo"><h2>Gaining Power</h2>
    <p>
        There may be times where you feel as though you've hit a wall and are at a loss at how to raise your BP anymore.
        That is normal, and is what the developers intended to entice you to spend more money on the game.</p>
        <p>Therefore I feel obligated to let you know:</p>
        
        <ul><li>This game is very much Pay 2 Win and many of the players have paid thousands or more.</li>
        <li>If you decide not to spend money on the game, you may see very slow results towards your power.
        </li>
    <li>I'm not advertising for the game, my point is that seeing other members suddenly soar beyond you in power doesn't mean you're behind or doing something wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h3>So what should I do?</h3>
<p>Start by assessing what your current power is made of. Access your Character Panel and find the Power Up tab.<br>
Here you'll see how much power you're gaining from all of the possible sources.</p>
