        Merfolk Attendant
    </h1>
            <div class="half"><p>Merfolk are mid-end game attendants that need to be caught and nurtured before they join your team. When
                fully matured, they have a base stat cap of 90/90/90 putting them in the same tier as Pol.</p>
                <p>Aside from their appearance, the only functional difference between the merfolk is the weapon type that
                they're strongest with. Since any attendant can attune to any weapon with Qi, the merfolk type doesn't
                really matter.</p>
                <div class="container-col">
                    <div>
                <h2 class="center">How to obtain a merfolk</h2></
                <p>Merfolk can be caught while fishing, purchased from the player market, or purchased from the premium shop
                    at
                    the cost of <span class="text-green">sage</span>.<br>
                    If you're eager to fish for your merfolk, open your map and follow along oceans until you find a merfolk
                    symbol.</p></div>
                    <img class="helperimg display-rightmiddle" alt="mer symbol" src="guides/images/merfolksymbol.jpg" />
            <p>That's where you'll want to spend some time fishing. Catching a merfolk usually doesn't take long and
                it's
                common to get one or two within the first few minutes. If it's taking a bit longer, just be patient,
                it'll
                happen.</p>

                Raising your Merfolk
            </h2>
    <section class="container-col half" href="#growing">
            <br><br>
            <p>Merfolk mature in 6 stages that each take 24 hours of incubation to complete. Your mermaid must be fed
                during each stage or it will die. Mermaids start with 1 hour of food, so it's a good idea to have all of
                the necessary food before attempting to grow your merfolk.<br>
                Each stage of maturity requires different food. After 24 hours of incubation, you can withdraw your
                Merfolk from the aquarium. It will then have a new prefix to it's name that determines whether it can
                mature again or if it has reached it's final maturity. <br>
                A merfolk may take multiple attempts before getting to the desired stage. When they reach their maturity, they
                will sometimes give hormones that can be fed to other merfolk to instantly skip the corresponding stage. This
                allows you to get your new merfolk caught up quickly to the failed stage with the downside that you will
                have to gather the food again for the failed stage.</p><br><br>
                As of <b>update 2.12.5</b> releasing certain merfolk will now produce items that can be turned into various legends or vendors.<br>
                In return, you'll receive items that can be used to upgrade your attendant's rarity. 

<aside>
    Certain aquariums in the premium shop will keep your merfolk alive even if it runs out of food.
