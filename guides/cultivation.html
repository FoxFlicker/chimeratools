                <span>Cultivation is a highly valuable life skill. It's recommended that you start working on it the moment you unlock it.
                <br>
                    From growing food, to potion materials, venus fly traps, and even upgrade materials, it's crucial for anyone at end game.</span>

    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>Cultivation starts by placing a core pylon somehwere in the map. This allows you to teleport to the pylon from anywhere, and also to begin building your base (farm).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Place your plots in the allotted grid. Then from the Home tab in your bag, find seeds available to place. Seeds and saplings can be purchased from the Home shop for a small amount of cowries.</p><br>
    <p>You'll be presented with two options when you target your plot.</p><br>
    <img src="guides/images/fertilizemenu.png" alt="fertilize menu" class="image" id="fertilizemenu">
    <ul><li>Fertilize</li>
        <p>Fertilizer is an expensive process that uses dung and dark cuisine to skip amounts of time remaining on a plants growth. Not recommended until farming Grand Trees.</p>
        <li>Farming</li>
    <p>Farming is the necessary option that waters the plots so your plant can grow. If your plant says "Paused" the plot needs to be farmed.</ul><br>
    
        <p>Farming mainly uses Plant Ash but can also use Dew and other materials. Level 6 plots will take a total of 100 plant ash each to reach max capacity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Plant ash can be obtained by smelting basic materials such as Logs, Fiber, Beast Hide, Parasitic Grass, Essences, and more.</p>
